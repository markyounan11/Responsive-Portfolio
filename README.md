# Responsive-Portfolio
Portfolio created using bootstrap

Thank you for visiting this README. This repository contains my professional business portfolio. Within the repository, you'll find links to three different HTML files all linked together with one CSS stylesheet.


The HTML files are labled 'index' 'contact' and 'portfolio'

Each of these files direct you to a certain page in the browser corresponding to the content included in the HTML. In 'index' there is a header that is common across all three pages that contains a main title and a navigation bar. The 'index' file also includes the "About Me' content which includes 2 short paragraphs about myself along with a profile picture. In 'contact' there is a form that allows you to enter input like your name, email, and a message. There is also a submit button. In the 'portfolio' page, you'll see pictures of my top 5 favorite activities, each with a corresponding label.

Across all the pages, there is a common background image that I used from Google Images.

I used Bootstrap to style the website, however there is a separate stylesheet linked to the html files called "style.css" which contains some of the positioning and finishing touches that I couldn't do with Bootstrap. My plan is to continue to work on the Bootstrap styling and will update and commit changes in the future.
Within the stylesheet, I did my best to separate each cluster of styling with a label for each corresponding page. The styles that were common across the three pages are located at the top of the page.
